# SIDE-Runner

#### This is basically selenium ide (SIDE) which is play the selenium script with CLI.

We have to download first latest nodejs.
Then check version of node and npm.
Now we have to download selenium-side-runner with this command

```
npm install -g selenium-side-runner
```


We have to also install the npm packages for different browser drivers too.
We will install for chrome browser with this command 
```
npm install -g chromedriver
```

Now you have saved project of selenium GUI, In which folder you have to open and put the downloaded chrome driver package.(Since i'm using ubuntu so i don't need that)

If you are in windows you have to also set the enviroment variable.

Then simply run the command to run with CLI
```
selenium-side-runner << FULL PATH OF project.side >>
```

That's it....
